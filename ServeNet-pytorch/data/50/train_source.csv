Trigger Forge API,"Trigger.io has developed Forge, a cross-platform app framework that allows web developers to create native iOS and Android apps from a single HTML5 code database. Their SaaS build service employs a Python based open source command line tool that allows developers to execute a build using a single customized JSON config file, and then returns Forge-generated JavaScript and native code templates (their starter plan produces Chrome-ready JavaScript, Java for Android, and Objective-C for iOS). Using the provided Python build tools, app templates, and the build instructions generated by Forge, developers can then complete the final stages of the build locally. The process is completed when the contents of the developer's custom app codeHTML, CSS, and JavaScriptare injected into the Forge-generated code to create finalized native apps. Because the build is created before the integration of user code, developers can easily integrate changes to their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without re-running the build. Trigger's Forge API exposes a variety of methods for working with Forge generated code to create a custom user app experience. A few examples of the functionality provided by this API are detecting platforms, creating notifications, logging end-user preferences, managing tabs and toolbars, adding listeners, and accessing a mobile devices filesystem or camera.",Application Development,1374

Talis API,"The Talis Platform is open to any software developer and easily programmed using a Web API. Data is held in a reliable and safe environment and the API enables development of a vast range of information rich applications. The Platform works like a shared database capable of storing and searching both content and RDF metadata. Because the Platform infrastructure is shared every customer can immediately benefit from any improvements we make in performance or capacity. We continually improve the Platform and release new versions every month without disrupting or degrading service to applications relying on it. This means application developers can forget about downloading and upgrading and concentrate user experience and value. Data held in the platform is organised into stores which can be individually secured if need be. Any kind of content can be added to a store along with arbitrary RDF metadata. The content and metadata becomes immediately accessible over the Web and discoverable using both SPARQL and a free text search system with built in ranking of results according to relevance to the search terms. RDF provides a powerful and flexible data model which encourages linking and sharing of data and dramatically reduces the complexity of data integration. Because each store provides a uniform Web API regardless of the type of data it holds the Talis Platform gives unparalleled opportunities for reuse and remixing of data. The uniform Web API allows applications to easily search multiple stores of data, and the use of RDF enables the application to interpret and use the results with very little effort. This means that developers using the Talis Platform benefit immediately from an ecosystem of data and services that enable rapid development of applications with a strategy to continually evolve and improve them as they incorporate new types and sources of data.",Database,1891
Samepoint Real-Time Social Media API,"Samepoint has released Version 2 of its Social Media Monitoring API. This commercial API now provides simpler means for a developer to monitor any term in the Social Universe. Many data services provide a hose of information, leaving the responsibility to save and search data on the developer's side. The Samepoint Monitoring API only gives you, the developer, what you need. With its advanced search functions, it adds a new element in creating Monitoring Tools.. Up until this point, there has been a separation between the data stream and the application. The Samepoint Monitoring API allows the developer to tell the API what to monitor. As such, more focus can be put on the tool and not the aggregation of data, creating a lower cost in resources and time to create a monitoring tool.. How does it Work? In the scenario of creating a tool to monitor BrandX, a marketer may want to see what the general public is saying. BrandX may not get much chatter, but when it does, the marketer needs to know. In the hose method, a tool would have to look at the hose stream and capture what comes down. This is great for real time transactions. If the data is not time sensitive and will be used or research, this method may be too resource intensive.. The Anit-Hose approach, of the Samepoint Monitoring API provides a daily update to all that was said and is available anytime to process. This allows the marketer to simply monitor Brandx and the developer on fast endpoint to make a client application fro the marketer. All the marketer has to do is provide the keywords to monitor. As a result, the API is much less expensive to access than a hose solution. It can be used on-demand or ongoing.. Getting the Keywords into the API The process to get the keywords monitored is accomplished via a simple REST call. Each API user is allowed up to 5 keywords to monitor. The Samepoint System will monitor the term daily and results are immediately available for processing. Other Data For good measure, Samepoint Monitors the Brandz top 100 Brands, a very credible source for brand data. It also monitors top blogs in various verticals",Social,2131
