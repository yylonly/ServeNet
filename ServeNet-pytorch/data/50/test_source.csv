USGS Seamless Datasets API,"The USGS Seamless Datasets service is a collection of three API's that work in tandem to provide developers with a programmatic portal to the USGS Seamless and Tiled Server's data holdings. The Seamless Data Warehouse contains massive amounts of data compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS)two projects backed by the Department of the Interior to create, maintain, and allow access to geospatial data of the United States. The first of these API's is the Inventory Service, a data discovery service that provides information about what data is available in the server over a particular area of interest. The Request Validation Service uses dataset information generated by previous calls to the Inventory Service (including the user-defined area of interest) to verify and validate the informaiton, resulting in a fully parameterized URL or set of URL's that can be used by the download service. The download service takes the parameterized URL(s) created by the Request Validation Service to initiate a request for data, query the system for request status updates, and finally return the requested data to the user in XML format.",Mapping,1188
Simple Semantic Web Architecture and Protocol API,"The National Science Foundation, in conjunction with the University of Arizona, has made available the Simple Semantic Web Architecture and Protocol (SSWAP), an architectural protocol for semantic web services. The SSWAP HTTP API exposes a set of URL's that can be used to convert JSON formatted text files into SSWQP OWL (a web ontology standard) Resource Description Framework (RDF) XML graphs. This functionality is intended to address the gap between the more common, non-semantic JSON format and a semantic, SSWAP-compliant document. SSWAP is based on a Provider Description Graph (PDG), which is a human-readable, machine-parsable description of a provider of one or more semantic web services. Each service describes itself with a Resource Description Graph (RDG), invoked with a Resource Invocation Graph (RIG), and returned in a Resource Response Graph (RRG). Resources can be semantically discovered by sending a Discovery server a Resource Query Graph (RQG). All graphs, which are RDF-XML documents, follow this structural flow according to the SSWAP protocol. These graphs allow the semantic description of third-party idiosyncratic data and services using OWL semantic standards.",Tools,1192
TomTom Geocoding API,"The service generates precise geolocation and mapping coordinates and standardized addresses based on user or application input specifying a location in varying formats. It also provides information relevant to the location, including businesses and other organizations nearby, geographic features, and places of interest. The precision of geolocation is influenced by the detail of data submitted to the service. General information about the location will return a neighborhood, postal code, or street, while more specific information can be resolved to a precise physical address. API methods support submission of known location data, either as free text or structured parameters. Optional parameters include the street or thoroughfare, the section or specific spot along that thoroughfare, the postal code, and the district or neighborhood, city, state or province, and any other administrative zone (e.g., a county). Depending on the completeness of the request, the API returns mapping specifications for either a general area or a precise physical address in standard format. Methods allow either individual submission of a single location or batch submission of a group of distinct locations.",Mapping,1201

HUSAR Bioinformatics Lab API,"The HUSAR Bioinformatics Lab at DKFZ provides a large number of freely available APIs. Many of these are useful in aligning DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. Alignments can be pairwise or multiple, local or global. Some of the APIs help visualize sequences or alignment results. Others edit biological sequences to make them more comprehensible to researchers. One large group of APIs is dedicated specifically to working with nucleic acid sequences. Some analyze sequence composition or codon usage, while others locate specific genes, motifs, or CpG islands within a sequence. One group of these APIs focuses on translating DNA sequences to proteins and vice versa. A handful of others focus on working with sequence profiles. Still more look for primers, repeats, restriction sites, or transcription factors. A few others allow the user to play with sequence mutations. Yet another group of APIs works exclusively with proteins. A few APIs in this category focus on identification and profiling. There are some that assess secondary and tertiary structure, while others focus on determining protein composition and motifs. A couple are designed to simulate mutations in proteins. A handful of miscellaneous APIs provide background information on sequences, alignment methods, available databases, and other relevant subjects. One simply returns the current EMBOSS version number. All of HUSAR's services are based on EMBOSS freeware and possess their own individual WSDL endpoints.",Science,1482
Hotwire API,"Hotwire is a discount travel site. Hotwire helps major travel providers fill airline seats, hotel rooms, and rental cars that would otherwise go unsold. Hotwire's APIs provide access to specified Hotwire.com data and services, and can be used as building blocks to develop a variety of applications of interest to travel shoppers and travel planners. You may choose to leverage Hotwire's Open APIs in any type of application you wish, within the conditions described in Hotwire's API Terms of Use. Possibilities include applications that run on web sites, mobile devices, or even desktops. The Hotel Deals API delivers data describing hotel Deals discovered on Hotwire.com in the past 24 hours. A deal is a Hotwire search result whose value is attractive relative to other results. The concept of value includes not only absolute price, but also star rating and the relative popularity of the location and of the travel dates. Tripstarter is a Hotwire feature designed to help travelers find the best time of year to travel to a particular destination. The feature offers a view of price trends for for airfares between your home city and your destination of interest, as well as historical weather data and price trends for hotels at the destination. Each record in the data returned indicates an average price (historical hotel rates or air fares) over a historical seven day period. Trends are revealed by examining price data over a period of time, or by examining year-over-year price changes.",Travel,1498
GeoRanker API,"GeoRanker enables users to view search engines' SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages) as a local user in over 5000 cities and 150 countries around the world. Because SERPs differ based on a user's location, these rankings reports are useful in determining the effectiveness of SEO strategies on an international level. GeoRanker uses depersonalized search queries, meaning that cookies are deleted before completing each search query. Bulk, real-time SERP rankings reports and real-time search engine crawling are the most powerful features of the GeoRanker platform. It also provides the SERP HeatMap generator, which concentrates large data reports into easy-to-read images. The GeoRanker API generates different types of reports and receives data for placement in the user's database. Further API documentation requires an email to the provider. We own hundreds of servers (crawlers) around the world, more than 50.000 Local IPs. Our API manages those servers in order to create accurate reports for almost any neighborhood, city, region or country in the world. The GeoRanker API collects data from crawlers in real time, creating a powerful and reliable Search Engine Keyword Reports. The information may be manipulated to create unlimited types of reports.

iGeolise Travel Time API,"The TravelTime platform API makes location-based data searchable by travel time rather than distance. It can map travel time areas for all common modes of transport (drive time maps, public transport commute maps, walking time maps and cycling mapsit's also possible to combine these modes). When used within a location search, it can search, map, sort and deliver results based on time rather than distance. For example if asking iwhere is reachable within 30 minutes drive from my location? i it can map the area and search through thousands of destinations. It also sorts the destinations from shortest to longest time. You can create a larger search area by searching 2+ origins simultaneously (combining shapes) as well as identify a unique search area suitable for 2+ points of origin (like the centre of a venn diagram). It's also useful for A > B routing and adjusts results based on the time of day. Suitable for property search sitesWhere should my family live to ensure <30 minute commute? Hotel search and accommodation searchWhich hotel is quickest to access the sights? Job searchWhich job roles are within 45 mins commute from my house? RetailFind the quickest store to reach. EntertainmentFind the closest cinema, restaurant, place to visit. Local councils and governmentfind public services by travel time. API methods support specification of an origin point by latitude and longitude, a travel mode, a time limit, and the type of destination. Returned data provide destinations of the requested type within the specified travel time range. Methods also allow specification of a point of origin, destination, and travel mode to receive the fastest available route. The API also supports geocoding for specified U.K. postal codes.",Transportation,1747
OpenStreetMap API,"OpenStreetMap is the free wiki world map, an open volunteer-driven initiative to collaboratively create a map of the world, and release the map data under a free and open license. There are actually many different APIs in and around the OpenStreetMap ecosystem. Many developers searching for an API, may actually be looking for an JavaScript web mapping library. There are a few of these to choose from including free and open source options such as LeafletJS. These work by fetching map tiles from a tile server, and there are several of these to choose from too (the main OpenStreetMap server is not the only option) Some developers may be looking for data downloads. You can download the entire planet's worth of map data from planet.openstreetmap.org, and keep in syc with community map updates, using the diff downloads. Or you can download smaller more manageable country-sized, or city-size extracts of OpenStreetMap data. We do have a thing called the OpenStreetMap API. This provides read and write operations on the raw map data of the OpenStreetMap database. It is actually primarily for OpenStreetMap editing software, and although any developers can create a new editor tool, this is not a small undertaking, and should be carried out with careful consultation with the OpenStreetMap community. In other words... this thing called the OpenStreetMap API is probably not what you're looking for! You can use the OpenStreetMap API to download small chunks of map data, but for this purpose it's also worth checking out some other options. In particular the OverpassAPI offers some flexible querying by tags etc, which may be useful for your app. Whether you're wrangling raw geo-data or presenting a web-map mashup, the possibilities provided by OpenStreetMap, and by third parties within the OpenStreetMap ecosystem, offer endless potential for geo map hacking fun! If you need help with development, join the osm-dev mailing list, or other OpenStreetMap contact channels",Mapping,1982
